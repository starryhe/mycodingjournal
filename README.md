  <title>你好，Hello</title>

  <h1>A new Jourey,新的旅程</h1>
  <p>今天是我学习CS的第一天，我终于终于在codeacedemy的帮助下，写出了我的第一行代码。很简单的知道如何使用一些基本符号去打我现在的这段话。我今天真的在现学现卖了。</p>
  <p>估计现在没人知道我的GitHub，那不如我就用这个Branch来谢谢日记吧。好像很炫酷呢。</p>
  <h2>Someone I want to talk about</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>Areswang</li>
   <li>Maxwang</li>
   <li>Mattliu</li>
   <li>Lawrencexia</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Areswang</h3>
  <p>He changes me. In other words, he lead me to start the new pape of my life. In addition, he makes me feel some feelings. Some feelings that I coundn't believe that I would have. I have to say I like him. I know why. And I don't know why. I like hi because he is interesting and cool. Though I sometimes don't like his personality. He often acts superficially and makes other people feel embrassed. In other words, he is kind of toooo believe in himeself. He does help me a lot. But when he helping you, he would make you feel that you are a idiot. I know it is his personality, however I will still feel not good. </p>
  <p> He changed recently. I can tell that he lose interest in me. Maybe it is because he is just a person of this kind. Maybe it is because I told him that I like him. Maybe it is because I am as fat as ususal. Maybe it is because he just doesn't want to play with me and thinks that I am boring.</p>
  <p> I don't feel good. I still want to go to bar with him. I still want him to take to the 钱塘弓社. I still hope that he can chat with me on wechat untill 3:00 am. I really really miss hi when he was not in the mood playing with me. I feel depressed.</p>
